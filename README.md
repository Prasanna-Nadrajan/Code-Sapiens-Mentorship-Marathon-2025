# üé¨ Stream-Verse: A Mini OTT Platform

## Project Goal
This is the frontend repository for **Stream-Verse**, a project developed as part of the Codesapiens 4-Week Frontend Mentorship Marathon. The primary goal is to build a functional **mini OTT (Over-The-Top) streaming platform prototype** using **React.js**.

The application will feature a basic media library, responsive design, and core user interactions (like saving an item to a watch list or marking content as watched).

## üéØ Current Status: Week 1 - Foundation & Setup

We are currently focused on Week 1 of the milestone plan: establishing the foundation and building core functionality.

### Week 1 Deliverable
A working prototype with basic add/create functionality (e.g., adding a new item to the library or a watch list) and navigation is in progress.

### Completed Milestones
* **Project Setup:** React project initialized using Vite.
* **Structure:** Basic folder structure created (`src/components`, `src/pages`, etc.).
* **Version Control:** Git repository set up and initial commit pushed to GitHub.

---

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend Framework:** React.js
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Language:** JavaScript (JSX)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **State Management:** Local State (`useState`)
